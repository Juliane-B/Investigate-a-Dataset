# Investigate-a-Dataset
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project: Investigate a Dataset

## Overview
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue,cast,release year.

The project involved data assessment and cleaning, analysing and drawing conclusions from the data.

## Technologies Used
- Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings
As per my overall analysis I have found
- For the audience the ideal length of movies is between 100 and 200 minutes
- Movies with a runtime longer than 200 minutes are little popular by the audience as they assessed those movies with a popularity score of 0 to 1.
- The movie 'Avatar' made the highest revenue ever in history with more than 2.7 billion USD, followed by 'Star Wars: The Force awakens' (2 billion USD) and 'Titanic' (1.8 billion USD).
- The movie industry has grown strongly between 1960 and 2015. While in 1960 only 55 movies were released, the number increased 14 times to 700 in 2015.
